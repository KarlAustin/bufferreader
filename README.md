# bufferreader
A utility package for reading binary data from a []byte slice.

# Todo
Need to add error checking, rather than just blindly ignoring.

# Acknowledgements
This is largely based on [fmtbytes](https://github.com/pisdhooy/fmtbytes) but instead of reading from a file, it reads from a []byte slice instead and built to use methods as that suits what I wanted it for better.
